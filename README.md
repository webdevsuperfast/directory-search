# Directory Search

## Introduction

Directory Search is a VueJS application that uses Google to search open directory files.

## Building from Source

1. Install Git.
2. Install NodeJS.
3. Install Yarn (**optional**).
4. Install Gulp globally with `yarn global add gulp-cli` or `npm install -g gulp-cli`.
5. Download or clone repository.
6. Run `yarn intall` or `npm install` to install dependencies through your favorite CLI program or VSCode Terminal.
7. Run `yarn serve` or `npm serve` to compile and hot-reload files for development.

**Note:** 
I suggest using package managers to install Git, NodeJS and yarn. For Windows, you can use [scoop](https://scoop.sh) or [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org). For Mac/Linux/WSL(Windows 10), use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh).

## Building for Production

1. Run `yarn build` or `npm build` to compile and minify files for production.

## Linting

1. Run `yarn lint` or `npm lint` to lint and fix errors from files
